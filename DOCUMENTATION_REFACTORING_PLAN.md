# Documentation Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the necessary steps to refactor and update the FinAegis documentation to match the current implementation state and improve organization.

## Current Issues

1. **Outdated Content**: Documentation reflects Phase 5.2 state while implementation is at Phase 6.3
2. **Redundant Files**: Some files duplicate content or serve overlapping purposes
3. **Poor Organization**: Duplicate directory numbering and misplaced files
4. **Missing Documentation**: Key features lack proper documentation

## Refactoring Actions

### 1. File Reorganization

#### Move to Appropriate Locations
- [ ] `API_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION/API_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- [ ] `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] `BIAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` → `docs/04-API/BIAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- [ ] `BEHAT.md` → `docs/06-DEVELOPMENT/BEHAT.md`

#### Fix Directory Numbering
- [ ] Rename `04-DEVELOPER` → `09-DEVELOPER`
- [ ] Rename `05-OPERATIONS` → `10-OPERATIONS`
- [ ] Rename `06-USER-GUIDES` → `11-USER-GUIDES`
- [ ] Update all internal links after renaming

2. Add missing release notes
3. Update FEATURES.md with implemented features

### Phase 2: Reorganization (Day 1)
1. Move files to correct locations
2. Fix directory numbering
3. Update internal links

### Phase 3: New Documentation (Day 2)
1. Create webhook integration guide
2. Create performance guide
3. Consolidate user guides

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Day 3)
1. Remove redundancies
2. Update cross-references
3. Final review and validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All documentation reflects current implementation state
- [ ] No duplicate or redundant content
- [ ] Clear, logical organization structure
- [ ] All features have appropriate documentation
- [ ] Easy navigation between related documents
- [ ] Consistent formatting and style

## Notes

- Preserve all historical information in archive folder
