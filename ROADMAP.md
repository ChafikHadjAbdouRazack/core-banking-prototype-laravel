# FinAegis Platform Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-15  
**Version:** 2.0

## Vision

FinAegis is evolving from a traditional core banking platform to a comprehensive **decentralized asset management and governance platform**. This roadmap outlines our journey to support multi-asset ledgers, multi-custodian management, and user-driven governance while maintaining our core principles of being scalable, secure, and auditable.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Multi-Asset Support**: Transform from currency-centric to asset-centric architecture
2. **Decentralized Custody**: Enable funds to be held across multiple financial institutions
3. **Democratic Governance**: Implement user-driven decision making through polling
4. **Universal Modularity**: Build reusable components for complex financial products
5. **Maintain Core Excellence**: Preserve existing banking functionality while expanding capabilities

  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage, gradual migration
  
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with multi-asset support
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, implement caching, use read models

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Regulatory compliance complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Modular compliance engine, jurisdiction awareness
  
- **Risk**: Custodian integration failures
  - **Mitigation**: Saga pattern, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms

## Development Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must maintain existing functionality
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Documentation First**: Update docs before coding
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship small, working increments
5. **Performance Focus**: Maintain sub-100ms response times
