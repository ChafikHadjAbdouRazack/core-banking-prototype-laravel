## Compliance Monitoring DDD Implementation Plan

### 1. Event Sourcing Infrastructure
- [x] Create compliance_events table migration
- [ ] Define domain events for ComplianceAlert lifecycle
- [ ] Define domain events for ComplianceCase lifecycle  
- [ ] Define domain events for TransactionMonitoring lifecycle
- [ ] Create event handlers and projections

### 2. Aggregates & Value Objects
- [ ] ComplianceAlertAggregate with business rules
- [ ] ComplianceCaseAggregate with state management
- [ ] TransactionMonitoringAggregate with pattern detection
- [ ] Value objects for AlertStatus, CasePriority, RiskLevel

### 3. Repositories (Event Sourcing Pattern)
- [ ] ComplianceAlertRepository with event store
- [ ] ComplianceCaseRepository with projections
- [ ] TransactionMonitoringRepository with streaming
- [ ] MonitoringRuleRepository with caching

### 4. Sagas & Workflows
- [ ] AlertEscalationSaga (alert â†’ case creation)
- [ ] TransactionMonitoringWorkflow (real-time analysis)
- [ ] BatchAnalysisWorkflow (async processing)
- [ ] CaseResolutionSaga (multi-step resolution)

### 5. Fix Controller Issues
- [ ] ComplianceAlertController - 8 failures
- [ ] ComplianceCaseController - 2 failures  
- [ ] TransactionMonitoringController - 9 failures

### 6. Test Fixes
- [ ] Ensure all 38 tests pass
- [ ] Add event sourcing test helpers
- [ ] Mock external dependencies properly

### Test Status: 19/38 passing (50%)
Target: 38/38 passing (100%)
