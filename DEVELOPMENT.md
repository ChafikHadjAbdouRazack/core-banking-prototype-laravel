# FinAegis Core Banking Platform - Developer Guide

## Overview

FinAegis is an open-source Core Banking as a Service platform built with Laravel 11, featuring event sourcing, domain-driven design, and workflow orchestration. This platform provides a robust foundation for banking operations with quantum-resistant security measures.

**ðŸ¤– AI-Friendly Development**: This project actively welcomes contributions from AI coding assistants including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other vibe coding tools. The well-structured architecture, comprehensive documentation, and clear patterns make it easy for AI agents to understand the codebase and contribute meaningfully.

## Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The platform follows DDD principles with clear domain boundaries:

```
app/Domain/
â”œâ”€â”€ Account/           # Account management domain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Aggregates/    # Domain aggregates (LedgerAggregate, TransactionAggregate)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Events/        # Domain events (AccountCreated, MoneyAdded, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DataObjects/   # Value objects (Account, Money, Hash)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Workflows/     # Business process workflows
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Activities/    # Individual workflow activities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Projectors/    # Event sourcing projectors
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Reactors/      # Event sourcing reactors
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Services/      # Domain services
â””â”€â”€ Payment/           # Payment processing domain
    â”œâ”€â”€ Services/      # Payment services
    â””â”€â”€ Workflows/     # Payment workflows
```

### Event Sourcing

The platform uses Spatie's Event Sourcing package to maintain a complete audit trail of all changes:

#### Key Components:

1. **Aggregates**: Business entities that generate events
   - `LedgerAggregate`: Manages account lifecycle
   - `TransactionAggregate`: Handles money movements
   - `TransferAggregate`: Manages transfers between accounts

2. **Events**: Domain events that capture state changes
   - `AccountCreated`, `AccountDeleted`, `AccountFrozen`, `AccountUnfrozen`
   - `MoneyAdded`, `MoneySubtracted`, `MoneyTransferred`
   - `TransactionThresholdReached`, `TransferThresholdReached`

3. **Projectors**: Build read models from events
   - `AccountProjector`: Maintains account state
   - `TurnoverProjector`: Calculates account turnovers

4. **Reactors**: Handle side effects
   - `SnapshotTransactionsReactor`: Creates snapshots when thresholds are reached
   - `SnapshotTransfersReactor`: Creates transfer snapshots

### Workflow Orchestration

The platform uses Laravel Workflow for saga pattern implementation:

#### Available Workflows:

1. **Account Management**
   - `CreateAccountWorkflow`: Account creation with validation
   - `DestroyAccountWorkflow`: Account closure with audit trail
   - `FreezeAccountWorkflow` / `UnfreezeAccountWorkflow`: Compliance operations

2. **Transaction Processing**
   - `DepositAccountWorkflow`: Deposit processing
   - `WithdrawAccountWorkflow`: Withdrawal processing
   - `TransactionReversalWorkflow`: Transaction reversal with compensation

3. **Transfer Operations**
   - `TransferWorkflow`: Money transfers with compensation patterns
   - `BulkTransferWorkflow`: Multiple transfers with rollback capabilities

4. **System Operations**
   - `BalanceInquiryWorkflow`: Balance inquiries with audit logging
   - `AccountValidationWorkflow`: KYC/compliance validation
   - `BatchProcessingWorkflow`: End-of-day batch operations

```

## Core Concepts

### Account Management

Accounts are managed through event sourcing with complete audit trails:

```php
use App\Domain\Account\Services\AccountService;

$accountService = app(AccountService::class);

// Create account
$accountService->create([
    'name' => 'Customer Account',
    'user_uuid' => $userUuid,
]);

// Deposit money
$accountService->deposit($accountUuid, 1000);

// Withdraw money
$accountService->withdraw($accountUuid, 500);

// Close account
$accountService->destroy($accountUuid);
```

### Transfer Processing

Transfers use the saga pattern with automatic compensation:

```php
use App\Domain\Payment\Services\TransferService;

$transferService = app(TransferService::class);

// Single transfer
$transferService->transfer(
    from: $fromAccountUuid,
    to: $toAccountUuid,
    amount: 1000
);

// Bulk transfer with compensation
$bulkTransfer = WorkflowStub::make(BulkTransferWorkflow::class);
$bulkTransfer->start($fromAccount, $transfers);
```

### Event Handling

Events are automatically processed by projectors and reactors:

```php
// Events are recorded in aggregates
$aggregate->recordThat(new MoneyAdded($money, $hash));

// Projectors update read models
class AccountProjector extends Projector
{
    public function onMoneyAdded(MoneyAdded $event): void
    {
        app(CreditAccount::class)($event);
    }
}

// Reactors handle side effects
class SnapshotTransactionsReactor extends Reactor
{
    public function onTransactionThresholdReached(): void
    {
        // Create snapshot
    }
}
```

### Security Features

#### Quantum-Resistant Hashing

All transactions use SHA3-512 hashing with validation:

```php
use App\Domain\Account\Utils\ValidatesHash;

trait ValidatesHash
{
    private const string HASH_ALGORITHM = 'sha3-512';
    
    protected function generateHash(?Money $money = null): Hash
    {
        return hydrate(Hash::class, [
            'hash' => hash(
                self::HASH_ALGORITHM,
                $this->currentHash . ($money ? $money->getAmount() : 0)
            ),
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### Event Integrity

All events include cryptographic hashes to ensure data integrity:

```php
class MoneyAdded extends ShouldBeStored implements HasHash, HasMoney
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly Money $money,
        public readonly Hash $hash
    ) {}
}
```

## API Usage

### Account Operations

```php
// Create account via service
$accountService = app(AccountService::class);
$accountService->create([
    'name' => 'Savings Account',
    'user_uuid' => auth()->user()->uuid,
]);

// Direct aggregate usage
$ledger = LedgerAggregate::retrieve($uuid);
$ledger->createAccount($account)->persist();
```

### Balance Inquiries

```php
$workflow = WorkflowStub::make(BalanceInquiryWorkflow::class);
$result = $workflow->start($accountUuid, $requestedBy);
// Returns: ['account_uuid', 'balance', 'account_name', 'status', 'inquired_at', 'inquired_by']
```

### Compliance Operations

```php
// Freeze account
$workflow = WorkflowStub::make(FreezeAccountWorkflow::class);
$workflow->start($accountUuid, 'Suspicious activity', $authorizedBy);

// Validate account
$workflow = WorkflowStub::make(AccountValidationWorkflow::class);
$workflow->start($accountUuid, [
    'kyc_document_verification',
    'address_verification',
    'compliance_screening'
], $validatedBy);
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Workflows

1. **Create Workflow Class**:
   ```php
   class MyCustomWorkflow extends Workflow
   {
       public function execute($param1, $param2): \Generator
       {
           return yield ActivityStub::make(
               MyCustomActivity::class,
               $param1,
               $param2
           );
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create Activity Class**:
   ```php
   class MyCustomActivity extends Activity
   {
       public function execute($param1, $param2, Dependencies $deps): mixed
       {
           // Business logic here
           return $result;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Add Tests**:
   ```php
   it('can execute my custom workflow', function () {
       WorkflowStub::fake();
       
       $workflow = WorkflowStub::make(MyCustomWorkflow::class);
       $workflow->start($param1, $param2);
       
       expect(true)->toBeTrue();
   });
   ```

### Adding New Events

1. **Create Event Class**:
   ```php
   class MyCustomEvent extends ShouldBeStored
   {
       public string $queue = EventQueues::CUSTOM->value;
       
       public function __construct(
           public readonly MyDataObject $data
       ) {}
   }
   ```

2. **Update Event Class Map**:
   ```php
   // config/event-sourcing.php
   'event_class_map' => [
       'my_custom_event' => App\Domain\MyDomain\Events\MyCustomEvent::class,
   ],
   ```

3. **Create Projector/Reactor**:
   ```php
   class MyCustomProjector extends Projector
   {
       public function onMyCustomEvent(MyCustomEvent $event): void
       {
           // Update read model
       }
   }
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Event Sourcing**:
   - Keep events immutable
   - Use descriptive event names
   - Include all necessary data in events
   - Validate event integrity with hashes

2. **Workflows**:
   - Design for failure and compensation
   - Keep activities idempotent
   - Log important workflow steps
   - Use timeouts for long-running operations

3. **Security**:
   - Always validate hashes
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Use proper authorization checks
   - Implement audit trails

4. **Testing**:
   - Test aggregates with fake events
   - Test workflows with WorkflowStub::fake()
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
   - Test compensation logic

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Event Store Debugging

```php
// View stored events
$events = StoredEvent::where('aggregate_uuid', $uuid)->get();

// Replay events to specific projector
php artisan event-sourcing:replay MyProjector
```

### Workflow Monitoring

```php
// Check workflow status
$workflow = StoredWorkflow::find($workflowId);
echo $workflow->status; // running, completed, failed

// View workflow logs
$logs = $workflow->logs;
```

### Queue Monitoring

```php
// Monitor event processing queues
php artisan horizon:status
php artisan queue:work --queue=events,ledger,transactions,transfers
```
