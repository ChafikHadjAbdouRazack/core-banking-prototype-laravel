## üöÄ Development Guidelines

### Infrastructure Configuration

```bash
# Demo Environment (finaegis.org)
DOMAIN_ENABLE_HANDLERS=false  # Handlers optional for demo

# Production Environment
DOMAIN_ENABLE_HANDLERS=true   # Full handler registration
```

### Command Patterns

When implementing new features, follow these patterns:

1. **Commands**: Implement `Command` interface in `app/Domain/*/Commands/`
2. **Queries**: Implement `Query` interface in `app/Domain/*/Queries/`
3. **Handlers**: Create handlers in `app/Domain/*/Handlers/`
4. **Registration**: Register in `DomainServiceProvider::registerCommandHandlers()`

### Event Sourcing Patterns

- Use domain-specific event tables (e.g., `exchange_events`, `lending_events`)
- Implement aggregates extending `AggregateRoot`
- Create projectors for read models
- Use sagas for multi-step workflows

### Testing Requirements

- Minimum 50% code coverage for new features
- Unit tests for all handlers and services
- Integration tests for workflows and sagas
- E2E tests for critical user paths

## üìù Session Notes

### Next Session Priorities

1. Complete demo environment documentation
2. Create user guides for all sub-products
3. Update API documentation with new endpoints
4. Begin liquidity pool implementation

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor legacy payment gateway code
- [ ] Optimize database indexes
- [ ] Clean up deprecated API endpoints
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate service logic

### Known Issues

*No critical issues at this time. The platform is stable and ready for demo.*
