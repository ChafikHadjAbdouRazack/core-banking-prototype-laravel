## üìã Current Priorities

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Documentation Organization

#### Documentation Status ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE

**Already Documented:**
- ‚úÖ Demo Environment: `docs/03-FEATURES/DEMO-MODE.md`, `docs/06-DEVELOPMENT/DEMO-ENVIRONMENT.md`
- ‚úÖ User Guides: Demo, GCU, Voting, Getting Started in `docs/11-USER-GUIDES/`
- ‚úÖ Sub-Product Guides: Stablecoin, P2P Lending, Liquidity Pools in `docs/05-USER-GUIDES/`
- ‚úÖ API Documentation: Complete REST API, BIAN, OpenAPI in `docs/04-API/`
- ‚úÖ Architecture: CQRS Infrastructure, Event Sourcing in `docs/02-ARCHITECTURE/`
- ‚úÖ Development: Infrastructure, Testing, Performance in `docs/06-DEVELOPMENT/`

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [x] Reorganized documentation (moved duplicates to archive)
- [ ] Add CQRS command/query examples to existing API docs
- [ ] Create event sourcing best practices guide
- [ ] Update workflow orchestration documentation

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Remaining Features

#### Phase 8.1: Liquidity Pool Management ‚úÖ COMPLETED (January 2025)
- ‚úÖ Built liquidity pool management system with event sourcing
- ‚úÖ Implemented automated market making (AutomatedMarketMakerService)

- ‚úÖ Designed pool rebalancing algorithms (PoolRebalancingService)
- ‚úÖ Implemented impermanent loss protection with tiered coverage
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive API endpoints (13 new endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Created pool analytics and metrics dashboard

#### Phase 8.5: FinAegis Treasury
- [ ] Cash management system design
- [ ] Treasury yield optimization
- [ ] Risk management framework
- [ ] Regulatory reporting for treasury operations

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Production Readiness

#### Infrastructure & DevOps
- [ ] **Monitoring & Observability**
  - [ ] Set up Prometheus/Grafana
  - [ ] Configure application metrics
  - [ ] Implement distributed tracing
  - [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK stack)

- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Security audit preparation
  - [ ] Penetration testing
  - [ ] OWASP compliance check
  - [ ] Rate limiting optimization

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Database query optimization
  - [ ] Cache strategy refinement
  - [ ] API response time improvement
  - [ ] Load testing and capacity planning

#### Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] EMI license application preparation
- [ ] GDPR compliance audit
- [ ] AML/CFT policy implementation
- [ ] Transaction monitoring system

## üöÄ Development Guidelines

### Infrastructure Configuration

```bash
# Demo Environment (finaegis.org)
DOMAIN_ENABLE_HANDLERS=false  # Handlers optional for demo

# Production Environment
DOMAIN_ENABLE_HANDLERS=true   # Full handler registration
```

### Command Patterns

When implementing new features, follow these patterns:

1. **Commands**: Implement `Command` interface in `app/Domain/*/Commands/`
2. **Queries**: Implement `Query` interface in `app/Domain/*/Queries/`
3. **Handlers**: Create handlers in `app/Domain/*/Handlers/`
4. **Registration**: Register in `DomainServiceProvider::registerCommandHandlers()`

### Event Sourcing Patterns

- Use domain-specific event tables (e.g., `exchange_events`, `lending_events`)
- Implement aggregates extending `AggregateRoot`
- Create projectors for read models
- Use sagas for multi-step workflows

### Testing Requirements

- Minimum 50% code coverage for new features
- Unit tests for all handlers and services
- Integration tests for workflows and sagas
- E2E tests for critical user paths

## üìù Session Notes

### Next Session Priorities

1. Complete demo environment documentation
2. Create user guides for all sub-products
3. Update API documentation with new endpoints
4. Begin liquidity pool implementation

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor legacy payment gateway code
- [ ] Optimize database indexes
- [ ] Clean up deprecated API endpoints
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate service logic

### Known Issues

*No critical issues at this time. The platform is stable and ready for demo.*

## üîß Quick Commands
