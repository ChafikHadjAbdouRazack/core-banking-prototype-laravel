## Architecture Overview

### Domain-Driven Design Structure
- **Account Domain** (`app/Domain/Account/`): Core banking account management with multi-asset support
- **Asset Domain** (`app/Domain/Asset/`): Multi-asset ledger, exchange rates, and asset management
- **Exchange Domain** (`app/Domain/Exchange/`): Exchange rate providers and currency conversion
- **Custodian Domain** (`app/Domain/Custodian/`): External custodian integration framework
- **Governance Domain** (`app/Domain/Governance/`): Democratic governance and polling system
- **Payment Domain** (`app/Domain/Payment/`): Transfer and payment processing
- Each domain has Aggregates, Events, Workflows, Activities, Projectors, Reactors, and Services

### Caching Architecture
- **Redis-based caching** for high-performance data access
- **Cache Services**: `AccountCacheService`, `TransactionCacheService`, `TurnoverCacheService`
- **Cache Manager**: Centralized cache coordination with automatic invalidation
- **TTL Strategy**: Different cache durations based on data volatility
  - Accounts: 1 hour
  - Balances: 5 minutes
  - Transactions: 30 minutes
  - Turnovers: 2 hours
- **Schema Updates**: Turnover model now supports separate `debit` and `credit` fields for proper accounting

### Event Sourcing Architecture
- **Aggregates**: `LedgerAggregate`, `TransactionAggregate`, `TransferAggregate`, `AssetTransactionAggregate`, `AssetTransferAggregate`
- **Events**: `AccountCreated`, `MoneyAdded`, `MoneySubtracted`, `MoneyTransferred`, `AssetBalanceAdded`, `AssetBalanceSubtracted`, `AssetTransferred`, `AssetTransactionCreated`, `AssetTransferInitiated/Completed/Failed`, `ExchangeRateUpdated`
- **Projectors**: Build read models from events (`AccountProjector`, `TurnoverProjector`, `TransactionProjector`, `AssetTransactionProjector`, `AssetTransferProjector`, `ExchangeRateProjector`)
- **Reactors**: Handle side effects (`SnapshotTransactionsReactor`, `SnapshotTransfersReactor`)

### Workflow Orchestration (Saga Pattern)

## Key Development Patterns

### Creating Workflows
Workflows follow the saga pattern with compensation logic:
```php
// Simple workflow
class DepositAccountWorkflow extends Workflow
{
    public function execute(AccountUuid $uuid, Money $money): \Generator
    {
        return yield ActivityStub::make(DepositAccountActivity::class, $uuid, $money);
    }
}

// Compensatable workflow
class TransferWorkflow extends Workflow
{
    public function execute(AccountUuid $from, AccountUuid $to, Money $money): \Generator
    {
        try {
            yield ChildWorkflowStub::make(WithdrawAccountWorkflow::class, $from, $money);
            $this->addCompensation(fn() => ChildWorkflowStub::make(DepositAccountWorkflow::class, $from, $money));
            
            yield ChildWorkflowStub::make(DepositAccountWorkflow::class, $to, $money);
        } catch (\Throwable $th) {
            yield from $this->compensate();
            throw $th;
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Handling
Events are recorded in aggregates and processed by projectors/reactors:
```php
// Recording events in aggregates
$aggregate->recordThat(new MoneyAdded($money, $hash));

// Processing in projectors
class AccountProjector extends Projector
{
    public function onMoneyAdded(MoneyAdded $event): void
    {
        app(CreditAccount::class)($event);
    }
}
```

### Security Implementation
All financial events include quantum-resistant hashes:
```php
class MoneyAdded extends ShouldBeStored implements HasHash, HasMoney
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly Money $money,
        public readonly Hash $hash
    ) {}
}
```

## Testing Patterns

### Workflow Testing
```php
it('can execute transfer workflow', function () {
    WorkflowStub::fake();
    
    $workflow = WorkflowStub::make(TransferWorkflow::class);
    $workflow->start($fromAccount, $toAccount, $money);
    
    WorkflowStub::assertDispatched(WithdrawAccountActivity::class);
    WorkflowStub::assertDispatched(DepositAccountActivity::class);
});
```

### Aggregate Testing
```php
it('can record money added event', function () {
    $aggregate = TransactionAggregate::retrieve($uuid);
    $aggregate->credit($money);
    
    expect($aggregate->getStoredEvents())->toHaveCount(1);
    expect($aggregate->getStoredEvents()[0])->toBeInstanceOf(MoneyAdded::class);
});
```

### Model Factory Testing
```php
// AccountFactory provides realistic test data
it('can create account with factory', function () {
    $account = Account::factory()->create();
    
    expect($account->uuid)->toBeString();
    expect($account->user_uuid)->toBeString();
    expect($account->balance)->toBeInt();
});

// Factory states for specific scenarios
$zeroAccount = Account::factory()->zeroBalance()->create();
$richAccount = Account::factory()->withBalance(100000)->create();
$userAccount = Account::factory()->forUser($user)->create();
```

### Filament Resource Testing
```php
// Test admin dashboard resources
it('can list accounts in admin panel', function () {
    $accounts = Account::factory()->count(5)->create();
    
    livewire(AccountResource\Pages\ListAccounts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($accounts);
});

// Test account operations
it('can deposit money through admin panel', function () {
    $account = Account::factory()->create();
    
    livewire(AccountResource\Pages\ListAccounts::class)
        ->callTableAction('deposit', $account, data: [
            'amount' => 50.00,
        ])
        ->assertHasNoTableActionErrors();
});
```

### Admin Dashboard Development
When working with Filament resources:
```php
// Creating custom actions
Tables\Actions\Action::make('custom_action')
    ->label('Custom Action')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-star')
    ->action(function (Model $record): void {
        // Action logic here
    })
    ->visible(fn (Model $record): bool => $record->canPerformAction());

// Adding bulk operations
Tables\Actions\BulkAction::make('bulk_process')
    ->action(function (Collection $records): void {
        foreach ($records as $record) {
            // Process each record
        }
    })
    ->requiresConfirmation();

// Custom widgets
class CustomWidget extends BaseWidget
{
    protected function getStats(): array
    {
        return [
            Stat::make('Label', 'Value')
                ->description('Description')
                ->color('success'),
        ];
    }
}

// Export functionality
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Exporter;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

// Add export to table header actions
Actions\ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(AccountExporter::class)
    ->label('Export Accounts')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-arrow-down-tray')
    ->color('success');

// Create exporter class
class AccountExporter extends Exporter
{
    protected static ?string $model = Account::class;

    public static function getColumns(): array
    {
        return [
            ExportColumn::make('uuid')->label('Account ID'),
            ExportColumn::make('balance')
                ->label('Balance (USD)')
                ->formatStateUsing(fn ($state) => number_format($state / 100, 2)),
        ];
    }
}
```

## Multi-Asset Development Patterns

### Asset Management
When implementing multi-asset support:
```php
// Creating Asset entity
namespace App\Domain\Asset\Models;

class Asset extends Model
{
    protected $primaryKey = 'code';
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $keyType = 'string';
    
    protected $fillable = [
        'code',      // 'USD', 'EUR', 'BTC', 'XAU'
        'name',      // 'US Dollar', 'Euro', 'Bitcoin', 'Gold'
        'type',      // 'fiat', 'crypto', 'commodity'
        'precision', // Decimal places (2 for USD, 8 for BTC)
        'is_active',
    ];
}

// Account with multi-asset balances
class Account extends Model
{
    public function balances(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(AccountBalance::class, 'account_uuid', 'uuid');
    }
    
    public function getBalance(string $asset_code): int
    {
        return $this->balances()
            ->where('asset_code', $asset_code)
            ->value('balance') ?? 0;
    }
    
    public function addBalance(string $asset_code, int $amount): void
    {
        $balance = $this->balances()->firstOrCreate(
            ['asset_code' => $asset_code],
            ['balance' => 0]
        );
        
        $balance->increment('balance', $amount);
    }
}
```

### Multi-Asset Events
Update events to include asset information:
```php
// Multi-asset event example
class AssetBalanceAdded extends ShouldBeStored
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $asset_code,
        public readonly int $amount,
        public readonly Hash $hash,
        public readonly ?array $metadata = []
    ) {}
}
```

### Exchange Rate Service
Working with exchange rates:
```php
// Usage in workflows
class CrossAssetTransferWorkflow extends Workflow
{
    public function execute(
        AccountUuid $from,
        AccountUuid $to,
        string $from_asset,
        string $to_asset,
        int $amount
    ): \Generator {
        // Get exchange rate
        $rate = yield ActivityStub::make(
            GetExchangeRateActivity::class,
            $from_asset,
            $to_asset
        );
        
        // Calculate converted amount
        $converted_amount = (int) round($amount * $rate);
        
        // Perform transfers
        yield from $this->executeTransfers(
            $from,
            $to,
            $from_asset,
            $to_asset,
            $amount,
            $converted_amount
        );
    }
}

// Caching exchange rates
class ExchangeRateService
{
    public function getRate(string $from, string $to): float
    {
        return Cache::remember(
            "rate:{$from}:{$to}",
            300, // 5 minutes
            fn() => $this->fetchRateFromProvider($from, $to)
        );
    }
}
```

### Governance Implementation
Building polling system:
```php
// Creating a poll
$poll = Poll::create([
    'title' => 'Add support for Japanese Yen?',
    'type' => 'single_choice',
    'options' => [
        ['id' => 'yes', 'label' => 'Yes, add JPY support'],
        ['id' => 'no', 'label' => 'No, not needed'],
    ],
    'start_date' => now(),
    'end_date' => now()->addDays(7),
    'voting_power_strategy' => OneUserOneVoteStrategy::class,
    'execution_workflow' => AddAssetWorkflow::class,
]);

// Voting
class VoteController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Poll $poll, Request $request)
    {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'option_id' => 'required|string',
        ]);
        
        $votingPower = app($poll->voting_power_strategy)
            ->calculatePower($request->user(), $poll);
        
        Vote::create([
            'poll_id' => $poll->id,
            'user_uuid' => $request->user()->uuid,
            'selected_options' => [$validated['option_id']],
            'voting_power' => $votingPower,
        ]);
        
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Vote recorded']);
    }
}
```

### Testing Multi-Asset Features
```php
// Test multi-asset account
test('account can hold multiple asset balances', function () {
    $account = Account::factory()->create();
    
    $account->addBalance('USD', 10000);    // $100.00
    $account->addBalance('EUR', 5000);     // €50.00
    $account->addBalance('BTC', 100000000); // 1 BTC
    
    expect($account->getBalance('USD'))->toBe(10000);
    expect($account->getBalance('EUR'))->toBe(5000);
    expect($account->getBalance('BTC'))->toBe(100000000);
    expect($account->balances)->toHaveCount(3);
});
```
