Feature: Batch Processing
  In order to efficiently handle bulk operations
  As a system administrator
  I need to execute batch operations with proper error handling and compensation

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an administrator
    And the batch processing system is configured
    And multiple user accounts exist with various balances

  Scenario: End-of-day interest calculation batch
    Given 1000 active accounts exist
    And the daily interest rate is 0.01%
    When I execute the interest calculation batch
    Then interest should be calculated for all eligible accounts
    And interest should be credited to account balances
    And a batch summary report should be generated
    And the operation should complete within 5 minutes

  Scenario: Bulk account closure processing
    Given a list of 50 dormant accounts to close
    When I execute the account closure batch
    Then each account should be processed individually
    And balances should be transferred to designated accounts
    And accounts should be marked as closed
    And compliance notifications should be sent

  Scenario: Batch processing with partial failures
    Given a batch operation to update 100 account limits
    And 10 accounts have validation errors
    When the batch is executed
    Then 90 accounts should be updated successfully
    And 10 accounts should fail with specific error messages
    And successful operations should remain committed
    And failed operations should be logged for retry

  Scenario: Batch operation compensation on failure
    Given a batch operation updates account statuses
    And the operation fails halfway through
    When compensation is triggered
    Then all completed updates should be reversed
    And accounts should return to original state
    And compensation audit trail should be recorded
    And administrators should be notified

  Scenario: Scheduled regulatory reporting batch
    Given end-of-month reporting is scheduled
    When the batch reporting job executes
    Then CTR reports should be generated for large transactions
    And KYC compliance reports should be compiled
    And AML monitoring reports should be created
    And all reports should be stored securely

  Scenario: Batch operation monitoring and status
    Given a long-running batch operation is in progress
    When I check the batch status
    Then I should see:
      | Field              | Status         |
      | Progress           | 45% complete   |
      | Items Processed    | 450/1000      |
      | Success Count      | 440           |
      | Failure Count      | 10            |
      | Estimated Completion| 2 minutes     |

  Scenario: Concurrent batch operation management
    Given multiple batch operations are queued
    When the batch processor starts
    Then operations should be executed in priority order
    And critical operations should not be blocked
    And resource limits should be respected
    And conflicts should be detected and avoided

  Scenario: Batch operation rollback capability
    Given a completed batch operation needs to be undone
    When I request a batch rollback
    Then the system should analyze the impact
    And prompt for confirmation of affected records
    And execute compensation for all batch items
    And verify the rollback was successful

  Scenario: Performance optimization for large batches
    Given a batch operation needs to process 10000 records
    When the batch is configured for high performance
    Then records should be processed in parallel chunks
    And database connections should be optimized
    And memory usage should remain within limits
    And progress should be persisted for resumability

  Scenario: Batch operation audit and compliance
    Given batch operations handle sensitive financial data
    When any batch operation completes
    Then a complete audit log should be created
    And include details of all modified records
    And maintain data integrity checksums
    And be available for regulatory inspection
