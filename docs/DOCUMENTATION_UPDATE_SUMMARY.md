## Summary

All documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the unified FinAegis platform approach with modular sub-products. The platform now presents a cohesive vision where:

1. **GCU** remains the flagship product
2. **Sub-products** (Exchange, Lending, Stablecoins, Treasury) are optional modules
3. All products share the same infrastructure and codebase
4. Users have a unified experience across all services
5. The platform is positioned as a comprehensive financial infrastructure provider

## Next Steps

1. Update website content to reflect unified platform (next task)
2. Create sub-product specific user guides
3. Update API documentation with sub-product endpoints
4. Create deployment guides for enabling/disabling sub-products
