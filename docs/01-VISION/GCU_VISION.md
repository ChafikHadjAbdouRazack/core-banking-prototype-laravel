# Global Currency Unit (GCU) - Platform Vision

## Overview

**FinAegis** is a powerful enterprise-grade core banking platform built with event sourcing, multi-asset support, and democratic governance capabilities. 

**Global Currency Unit (GCU)** is the flagship implementation on FinAegis - a revolutionary user-controlled digital currency where:
- Your money stays in **real banks** with government deposit insurance
- You **choose which banks** hold your funds across multiple countries
- You **vote monthly** on the currency basket composition
- Full **regulatory compliance** ensures bank and government support

## The GCU Difference

- **Deposit Insurance**: Government protection up to €100k/bank in EU, $250k/bank in US
