# Global Currency Unit (GCU) - Conceptual Vision

## Overview

**FinAegis** is an open-source prototype demonstrating modern banking architecture with event sourcing, multi-asset support, and democratic governance patterns. 

**Global Currency Unit (GCU)** is a conceptual demonstration showing how a democratic digital currency could work:
- **Concept**: Money could stay in real banks with deposit insurance
- **Demonstration**: Shows how users could choose banks across countries
- **Prototype Feature**: Voting system for currency basket composition
- **Architecture Pattern**: How regulatory compliance could be implemented

## The GCU Difference

### For Users
- **Multi-Bank Distribution**: Split funds across 5 banks in 5 countries (e.g., 40% Paysera, 30% Deutsche Bank, 30% Santander)
- **Democratic Control**: Vote monthly on currency composition (USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, JPY, Gold)
- **Deposit Insurance**: Government protection up to ‚Ç¨100k/bank in EU, $250k/bank in US
- **Low Fees**: 0.01% conversion fees vs 2-4% traditional banking
- **Inflation Protection**: Currency diversification shields against local devaluation
