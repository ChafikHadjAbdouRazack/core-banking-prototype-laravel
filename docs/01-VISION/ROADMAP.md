# FinAegis Platform Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-21  
**Version:** 3.1 (GCU Implementation with Technical Debt Management)

## Vision

**FinAegis** is a powerful multi-asset banking platform that enables revolutionary financial products. **Global Currency Unit (GCU)** is the first major implementation built on FinAegis - a user-controlled digital currency where funds stay in real banks with deposit insurance, users vote on currency composition, and everyone benefits from distributed yet regulated financial innovation.

**Key Insight**: FinAegis already has 80% of the technical infrastructure needed for GCU. We will leverage our proven platform architecture to build GCU as a showcase implementation.

## Strategic Goals

1. **User-Controlled Global Currency**: Enable users to hold GCU backed by basket of currencies (USD/EUR/GBP/CHF/JPY/Gold)
2. **Multi-Bank Distribution**: Allow users to choose bank allocation (40% Paysera, 30% Deutsche Bank, 30% Santander) 
3. **Democratic Currency Control**: Monthly voting on currency basket composition with user governance
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Lithuanian EMI license pathway with full KYC/AML compliance
5. **Real Bank Integration**: Replace mock connectors with actual bank APIs while maintaining technical excellence
