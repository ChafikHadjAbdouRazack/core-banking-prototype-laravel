# FinAegis Prototype Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-07  
**Version:** 4.0 (CGO Complete, Documentation Review)

## Vision

**FinAegis** is a comprehensive banking prototype that demonstrates advanced financial architecture patterns. **Global Currency Unit (GCU)** is a conceptual demonstration built on FinAegis - showcasing how a user-controlled digital currency could theoretically work with real banks, democratic voting, and regulatory compliance.

**Key Insight**: This prototype demonstrates the technical patterns and architecture that would be needed for such systems, serving as an educational resource and foundation for future development.

## Strategic Goals (Prototype Demonstrations)

1. **Currency Basket Concept**: Demonstrate how a multi-currency basket could be technically implemented
2. **Bank Distribution Pattern**: Show architectural patterns for multi-bank allocation
3. **Governance System Demo**: Illustrate democratic voting mechanisms for financial systems
4. **Compliance Framework**: Example implementation of KYC/AML patterns
5. **Bank Integration Architecture**: Demonstrate connector patterns (currently mock implementations)

## 🏛️ Regulatory Strategy

### Regulatory Compliance Demonstration
This prototype demonstrates patterns that could be used for:
1. **EMI License Requirements**: Example KYC/AML implementations
2. **Compliance Workflows**: Demonstration of regulatory reporting
3. **Audit Trail Patterns**: Complete event sourcing for compliance
4. **Multi-Jurisdiction Support**: Architecture for regulatory flexibility

### Compliance Framework
- **KYC/AML**: Enhanced user verification workflows
- **MiCA Regulation**: Compliance with EU crypto-asset regulations  
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy controls
- **PCI DSS**: Secure payment card handling
- **Basel III**: Risk management framework

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Breaking changes to existing systems
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage, gradual migration
  
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with multi-asset support
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, implement caching, use read models

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Regulatory compliance complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Modular compliance engine, jurisdiction awareness
  
- **Risk**: Custodian integration failures
  - **Mitigation**: Saga pattern, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms

---

## Development Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must maintain existing functionality
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Documentation First**: Update docs before coding
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship small, working increments
5. **Performance Focus**: Maintain sub-100ms response times

---

## Community Involvement

We encourage community participation in:
- Feature prioritization through discussions
- Beta testing of new modules
- Contribution of custodian connectors
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimization

For questions or suggestions about this roadmap, please open a discussion on GitHub.
