            'enabled' => true,
            'features' => [
                'basket_voting' => true,
                'bank_allocation' => true,
                'currency_exchange' => true,
            ],
            'assets' => ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'CHF', 'JPY', 'XAU'],
        ],
        'litas' => [
            'enabled' => true,
