### Understanding Trading Pairs

Trading pairs represent the exchange rate between two assets:

- **Base Asset**: The asset you're buying/selling (e.g., BTC in BTC/USD)
- **Quote Asset**: The asset used for pricing (e.g., USD in BTC/USD)
- **Price**: How much quote asset for one unit of base asset

Example: BTC/USD at 45,000 means 1 BTC costs 45,000 USD
