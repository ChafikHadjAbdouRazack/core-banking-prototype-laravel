### Understanding Liquidation

**Liquidation occurs when:**

- Due to collateral price decline
- Or fee accumulation

**Liquidation Process:**
1. Position marked for liquidation
2. 13% penalty applied
3. Collateral auctioned
4. Debt repaid from proceeds
5. Remaining collateral returned

### Liquidation Example

```
Initial Position:
- Collateral: 1 BTC at $45,000
- Debt: 25,000 FUSD
- Ratio: 180%

BTC drops to $37,000:
- Collateral Value: $37,000
- Ratio: 148% (Below minimum!)
- Liquidation triggered

Liquidation:
- Penalty: 13% = $4,810
- Debt repaid: 25,000 FUSD
- Collateral sold: 0.83 BTC
- Returned: 0.17 BTC
- Loss: $4,810 + price impact
```
