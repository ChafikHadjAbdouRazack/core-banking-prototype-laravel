# CGO (Continuous Growth Offering) Implementation Plan

## Current Status: Development Environment Only

The CGO feature is currently in development mode with critical security measures in place to prevent accidental use in production.

## üîê Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Production Environment Protection
- **Production Block**: Crypto payments throw exception in production environment
- **Test Addresses**: Replaced real crypto addresses with obvious test placeholders
- **Warning Banners**: Added prominent warnings in test/staging environments

### 2. Visual Warnings Added

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### 1. Enable Safe Testing
```bash
# Install QR code package for testing
composer require simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode --dev

# Configure crypto addresses in .env
CGO_BTC_ADDRESS=tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx
CGO_ETH_ADDRESS=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f82b2d
CGO_USDT_ADDRESS=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f82b2d
CGO_USDC_ADDRESS=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f82b2d

# Configure bank details
CGO_BANK_NAME="Test Bank Ltd."
CGO_BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME="FinAegis Test Account"
CGO_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="TEST123456"
CGO_BANK_SWIFT_CODE="TESTSWIFT"

# Keep production safety enabled
CGO_PRODUCTION_CRYPTO_ENABLED=false
```

### 2. Test Payment Flows
- Use Stripe test cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Use Bitcoin testnet for crypto testing
- Create test bank transfer references

### 3. Verify Security Measures
- Ensure production environment check works
- Verify warning banners appear
- Test address validation

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Zero production incidents with test addresses
- 100% payment verification accuracy
- <5 second payment confirmation time
- 99.9% uptime for payment processing

### Business Metrics
- Conversion rate >40%
- Payment success rate >95%
- Average investment: $500-$5000
- User satisfaction >4.5/5

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

1. **NEVER deploy to production without:**
   - Real payment processor integration
   - KYC/AML compliance
   - Security audit completion
   - Legal review

2. **Current test addresses are intentionally broken**
   - This prevents accidental fund loss
   - Production deployment requires real integration
   - Test thoroughly with testnet first

3. **Regulatory compliance is mandatory**
   - Investment offerings have strict regulations
   - Consult legal counsel before launch
   - Ensure all licenses are in place
