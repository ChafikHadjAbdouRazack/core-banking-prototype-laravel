# Phase 5.2: Transaction Processing

## Overview

Phase 5.2 implements advanced transaction processing capabilities for the FinAegis platform, focusing on multi-bank transfers, intelligent routing, and efficient settlement mechanisms. This phase builds upon the custodian connectors from Phase 5.1 to enable seamless money movement across different financial institutions.

## Key Components

### 1. Multi-Custodian Transfer Service

The `MultiCustodianTransferService` provides intelligent routing for transfers between accounts held at different custodians (banks).

#### Features:
- **Automatic Route Detection**: Finds the optimal path for transfers
- **Three Transfer Types**:
  - **Internal**: Same custodian transfers (fastest)
  - **External**: Direct bank-to-bank transfers
  - **Bridge**: Through intermediate custodian when direct transfer unavailable
- **Smart Routing Strategies**: Configurable preference for speed, cost, or balance
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All transfers recorded in database

#### Usage:
```php
$transferService = app(MultiCustodianTransferService::class);

$receipt = $transferService->transfer(
    fromAccount: $account1,
    toAccount: $account2,
    amount: new Money(50000), // $500.00
    assetCode: 'EUR',
    reference: 'INV-12345',
    description: 'Invoice payment'
);
```

### 2. Settlement Service

The `SettlementService` manages inter-bank settlements to optimize money movement and reduce costs.

#### Settlement Types:

1. **Realtime Settlement**
   - Immediate settlement of each transfer
   - Highest cost but instant finality
   - Best for urgent or high-value transfers

2. **Batch Settlement**
   - Groups transfers by time interval (default: 60 minutes)
   - Reduces number of inter-bank transactions
   - Good balance of speed and cost

3. **Net Settlement**
   - Calculates net positions between custodians
   - Dramatically reduces settlement amounts
   - Example: If Bank A owes Bank B $1000 and Bank B owes Bank A $800, only $200 is settled
   - Can reduce settlement volumes by 60-80%

#### Configuration:
```php
// config/custodians.php
'settlement' => [
    'type' => 'net',
    'batch_interval_minutes' => 60,
    'min_settlement_amount' => 10000, // $100.00
]
```

#### Console Command:
```bash
# Process settlements
php artisan settlements:process

# Dry run to see what would be settled
php artisan settlements:process --dry-run

# Override settlement type
php artisan settlements:process --type=batch
```

### 3. Database Schema

#### Custodian Transfers Table
Tracks all transfers between custodian accounts:
- Transfer details (amount, asset, accounts)
- Transfer type (internal, external, bridge)
- Status tracking
- Settlement linkage
- Complete metadata

#### Settlements Table
Records settlement batches:
- Settlement type and status
- Gross vs net amounts
- Transfer count
- Custodian pairs
- Execution timestamps

## Implementation Details

### Transfer Routing Algorithm

1. **Check Same Custodian**: Fastest path if both accounts are at the same bank
2. **Check Direct Transfer**: If source bank can transfer directly to destination
3. **Find Bridge Route**: If no direct path, find intermediate bank that can connect
4. **Validate Route**: Ensure all hops support the asset and meet requirements

### Settlement Processing

1. **Calculate Positions**: Aggregate all unsettled transfers between custodian pairs
2. **Apply Netting**: For net settlement, calculate offset positions
3. **Check Minimums**: Only settle if amount exceeds configured minimum
4. **Execute Settlement**: Use custodian APIs to perform actual money movement
5. **Update Records**: Mark transfers as settled and record settlement details

### Error Handling

- **Transfer Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Route Unavailable**: Falls back to alternative routing strategies
- **Settlement Failures**: Marked as failed with detailed error tracking
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for failures and performance issues

## Performance Optimizations

### Sub-Second Processing
- **Route Caching**: Recently used routes cached for 5 minutes
- **Parallel Processing**: Bridge transfers execute legs concurrently where possible
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections to custodian APIs
- **Optimistic Locking**: Prevent race conditions without blocking

### Settlement Efficiency
- **Smart Batching**: Groups transfers by custodian pair and asset
- **Dynamic Intervals**: Adjust batch timing based on volume
- **Minimum Thresholds**: Avoid small settlements that cost more than value
- **Multi-Currency**: Separate settlement tracks per currency

## Security Considerations

### Transfer Security
- **Digital Signatures**: All transfer requests cryptographically signed
- **Idempotency**: Duplicate transfer prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and errors
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all operations

### Settlement Security
- **Segregated Accounts**: Dedicated settlement accounts per custodian
- **Daily Reconciliation**: Automated balance verification
- **Approval Workflows**: High-value settlements require authorization
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Transfer Metrics
```php
$stats = $transferService->getTransferStatistics();
// Returns: total, completed, failed, by_type, success_rate, avg_completion_seconds
```

### Settlement Metrics
```php
$stats = $settlementService->getSettlementStatistics();
// Returns: total, by_type, savings_percentage, avg_settlement_time
```

### Real-time Monitoring
- Transfer success rates by route
- Settlement savings percentage
- Average processing times
- Custodian availability status

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites ensure reliability:

### Multi-Custodian Transfer Tests
- Internal transfer routing
- External transfer with multiple custodians
- Bridge transfer through intermediate
- Route unavailable scenarios
- Statistics calculation

### Settlement Service Tests
- Net settlement calculation
- Batch settlement grouping
- Minimum amount enforcement
- Failure handling
- Statistics tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5.3 Considerations
- **AI-Powered Routing**: Machine learning for optimal route selection
- **Predictive Settlement**: Forecast settlement needs and pre-position funds
- **Multi-Asset Settlement**: Cross-currency netting capabilities
- **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing for instant insights

### Integration Opportunities
- **Payment Networks**: SWIFT, SEPA Instant integration
- **Blockchain Rails**: Stablecoin settlement options
- **Central Bank APIs**: Direct RTGS access where available
- **FX Integration**: Built-in currency conversion during transfer

## Conclusion

Phase 5.2 transforms FinAegis into a true multi-bank platform capable of intelligently routing transfers and optimizing settlement costs. The implementation provides a solid foundation for global money movement while maintaining security, reliability, and cost efficiency.
