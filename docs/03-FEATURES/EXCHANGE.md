## Architecture

### Event-Driven Design
The exchange uses event sourcing for all operations:
- `OrderPlaced`: When a new order is created
- `OrderMatched`: When orders are matched
- `OrderFilled`: When an order is completely filled
- `OrderCancelled`: When an order is cancelled
- `OrderPartiallyFilled`: When an order is partially executed

### Domain Components
1. **Order Aggregate**: Manages individual order lifecycle
2. **OrderBook Aggregate**: Maintains bid/ask order collections
3. **Matching Engine**: Workflow-based order matching
4. **Fee Calculator**: Dynamic fee calculation service

### Workflow-Based Matching
The order matching process uses Laravel Workflow:
1. **Validate Order**: Check account, balance, and parameters
2. **Lock Balance**: Reserve funds for the order
3. **Add to Order Book**: Place order in appropriate queue
4. **Match Orders**: Find and execute matches
5. **Transfer Assets**: Move assets between accounts
6. **Update Order Book**: Remove filled orders

## Testing

### Feature Tests (Behat)
```gherkin
Feature: Exchange Trading
  Scenario: Place a limit buy order
    Given I am logged in as "alice@example.com"
    When I place a limit buy order for "0.1" "BTC" at "48000" "EUR"
    Then the order should be placed successfully
    And my "EUR" balance should be reduced by "4800.00"
```

### Unit Tests
