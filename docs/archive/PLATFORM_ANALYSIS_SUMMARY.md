## Technical Implementation Guide

### 1. Service Registration Pattern

```php
// app/Providers/DemoServiceProvider.php
public function register()
{
    if (config('demo.mode')) {
        // Demo services
        $this->app->bind(ExchangeServiceInterface::class, DemoExchangeService::class);
        $this->app->bind(LendingServiceInterface::class, DemoLendingService::class);
        $this->app->bind(StablecoinServiceInterface::class, DemoStablecoinService::class);
    } elseif (config('demo.sandbox.enabled')) {
        // Sandbox services
        $this->app->bind(ExchangeServiceInterface::class, SandboxExchangeService::class);
        // ... other sandbox bindings
    } else {
        // Production services
        $this->app->bind(ExchangeServiceInterface::class, ProductionExchangeService::class);
        // ... other production bindings
    }
}
```

### 2. Demo Service Example

```php
// app/Domain/Exchange/Services/DemoExchangeService.php
class DemoExchangeService implements ExchangeServiceInterface
{
    public function placeOrder(Order $order): OrderResult
    {
        // Simulate instant fill for demo
        return new OrderResult([
            'order_id' => 'demo_ord_' . uniqid(),
            'status' => 'filled',
            'filled_amount' => $order->amount,
            'price' => $this->getSimulatedPrice($order->pair),
            'timestamp' => now(),
            'demo' => true
        ]);
    }
    
    private function getSimulatedPrice(string $pair): string
    {
        // Return fixed or slightly varying price
        $basePrices = config('demo.demo_data.exchange.prices', []);
        $variation = rand(-100, 100) / 10000; // ¬±0.01 variation
        return number_format($basePrices[$pair] + $variation, 4);
    }
}
```

### 3. Configuration Structure

```php
// config/demo.php
return [
    'mode' => env('DEMO_MODE', false),
    'sandbox' => [
        'enabled' => env('DEMO_SANDBOX_ENABLED', false),
    ],
    'demo_data' => [
        'exchange' => [
            'auto_fill_orders' => true,
            'prices' => [
                'EUR/USD' => 1.10,
                'GBP/USD' => 1.27,
                'GCU/USD' => 1.00,
            ],
        ],
        'lending' => [
            'auto_approve_threshold' => 10000,
            'default_credit_score' => 750,
        ],
        'stablecoin' => [
            'collateral_ratio' => 150,
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Conclusion

The FinAegis platform has a **strong technical foundation** with excellent architecture patterns. The immediate priority should be:

1. **Complete demo service implementations** for Exchange, Lending, and Stablecoin domains
2. **Improve test coverage** especially for domains with no tests
3. **Prepare for third-party integrations** with sandbox environments

With 3 weeks of focused development, the platform can have a fully functional demo environment ready for showcasing. Production deployment will require additional 2-3 months for compliance, security, and third-party integrations.
