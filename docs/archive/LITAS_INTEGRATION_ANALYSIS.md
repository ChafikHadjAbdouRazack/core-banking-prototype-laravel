## Technical Architecture Updates

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- New tables needed
CREATE TABLE crypto_wallets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    account_uuid UUID REFERENCES accounts(uuid),
    currency VARCHAR(10), -- BTC, ETH
    address VARCHAR(255),
    public_key TEXT,
    derivation_path VARCHAR(255),
    wallet_type ENUM('hot', 'cold'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE loans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    borrower_account_uuid UUID REFERENCES accounts(uuid),
    amount DECIMAL(36, 18),
    currency VARCHAR(10),
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    term_months INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    funded_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE loan_investments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_id UUID REFERENCES loans(id),
    investor_account_uuid UUID REFERENCES accounts(uuid),
    amount DECIMAL(36, 18),
    crypto_litas_issued DECIMAL(36, 18),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE stablecoin_reserves (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    amount_eur DECIMAL(36, 18),
    stable_litas_issued DECIMAL(36, 18),
    bank_account VARCHAR(255),
    verified_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Service Layer Extensions
```php
// New services needed
interface CryptoWalletService {
    public function generateWallet(string $currency): CryptoWallet;
    public function getBalance(string $address): Money;
    public function sendTransaction(string $from, string $to, Money $amount): string;
}

interface StablecoinService {
    public function mint(Money $euroAmount): string;
    public function burn(Money $stableLitasAmount): void;
    public function getReserveBalance(): Money;
    public function verifyBacking(): bool;
}

interface LendingService {
    public function createLoan(LoanApplication $application): Loan;
    public function fundLoan(string $loanId, array $investments): void;
    public function processRepayment(string $loanId, Money $amount): void;
    public function distributeToInvestors(string $loanId): void;
}

interface TradingService {
    public function placeOrder(Order $order): string;
    public function matchOrders(): array;
    public function settleTrade(Trade $trade): void;
}
```

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
1. **Blockchain Integration Complexity**: Requires robust infrastructure
2. **Smart Contract Security**: Critical for stablecoin implementation
3. **Scalability**: High-frequency trading and transaction volume
4. **Regulatory Changes**: MiCA implementation timeline

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use established blockchain libraries (BitcoinJS, Web3.js)
2. External smart contract audits before launch
3. Implement caching and queue-based processing
4. Regular regulatory compliance reviews

## Conclusion

FinAegis provides an excellent foundation for the Litas platform, with approximately 60% of required infrastructure already in place. The multi-asset architecture, transaction processing, and compliance framework can be directly leveraged. The main development effort will focus on:

1. Crypto-specific integrations (wallets, blockchain connectivity)
2. Stablecoin infrastructure (minting, reserves, redemption)
3. Lending marketplace features
4. Secondary market trading engine

By building on FinAegis, the Litas project can accelerate development by 3-4 months and ensure a robust, compliant foundation for the crypto-fiat lending platform.
