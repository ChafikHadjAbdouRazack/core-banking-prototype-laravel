### 2. File Reorganization

#### Moved to Proper Locations
- `API_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION/`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION/`
- `BIAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` → `docs/04-API/`

### 3. Simplified Files

#### CLAUDE.md (root)
- Converted to a simple pointer to the comprehensive guide
- Removed redundant content

## Results

### Before Refactoring
- Documentation was 2-3 phases behind implementation
- Duplicate directory numbers caused confusion
- Some files had redundant content
- Missing documentation for Phase 6 features

### After Refactoring
- ✅ All documentation reflects current implementation (Phase 6.3)
- ✅ Clear, logical directory structure with unique numbers
- ✅ Each file has a distinct purpose
- ✅ Comprehensive navigation with docs/README.md
- ✅ Complete feature documentation

## Remaining Tasks

While the critical documentation updates are complete, the following enhancements are recommended:

1. **Add Missing Guides**
   - Deployment guide for production
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Backup and recovery procedures

2. **Update FEATURES.md**
   - Add GCU platform features section
   - Include performance testing capabilities
   - Document webhook delivery system

3. **Enhance User Documentation**
   - Add screenshots to user guides
   - Create video tutorials
   - Develop quick reference cards

## Maintenance

To keep documentation current:

1. Update RELEASE_NOTES.md with each version
2. Review ROADMAP.md after each phase completion
3. Update feature documentation as implemented
4. Run periodic documentation audits

## Conclusion

The documentation is now well-organized, current, and provides clear guidance for all stakeholders. The new structure makes it easy to find information and maintain documentation quality going forward.
