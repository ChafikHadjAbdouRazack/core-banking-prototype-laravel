# Test Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Parallel Testing Configuration ✅
- **CI Configuration**: Added `PEST_PARALLEL=true` to `phpunit.ci.xml`
- **GitHub Actions**: Updated all test jobs to use `--parallel` flag
- **Redis Configuration**: Added Redis host/port for CI environment
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive parallel testing guide

### 2. Stablecoin Test Refactoring ✅
- **Moved to Integration Tests**:
  - `StablecoinOperationsControllerTest` → `StablecoinOperationsIntegrationTest`
  - Created `StablecoinIssuanceIntegrationTest` for workflow-dependent tests
- **Benefits**:
  - Proper database usage instead of mocking
  - Real workflow execution with `WorkflowStub::fake()`
  - Better test coverage and reliability

### 3. Test Isolation Fixes ✅
- **Process Isolation**: TestCase properly sets up Redis and cache prefixes
- **Event Sourcing**: Isolated storage per test process
- **Database Transactions**: Using RefreshDatabase trait

### 4. Specific Test Fixes ✅
- **ProcessWebhookDeliveryTest**: Fixed HTTP timeout simulation
- **StabilityMechanismServiceTest**: Split combined tests to fix mock expectations

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Unit Test Failures (76 remaining)
These appear to be related to:
- Service container binding issues
- Mock expectations in parallel execution
- Shared state between tests

### 2. Categories of Remaining Failures
- **Settings Service Tests**: Container binding issues
- **Circuit Breaker Tests**: State management in parallel
- **Webhook Tests**: Exception type mismatches
- **Various Mock Issues**: Strict expectations failing in parallel

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Container Binding Issues**: Many tests fail due to missing service bindings
2. **Review Mock Usage**: Replace strict mocks with spies where appropriate
3. **Test Categorization**: Move more integration-style unit tests to Feature tests

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Test Architecture**:
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
   - Consistent use of test doubles
   - Better test data factories

2. **Parallel Testing Best Practices**:
   - Avoid global state
   - Use proper test isolation
   - Mock external services consistently

3. **CI/CD Optimization**:
   - Run test suites in parallel jobs
   - Cache dependencies between runs
   - Use matrix builds for PHP versions

## Test Statistics

### Before Fixes
- Parallel testing not enabled in CI
- Multiple skipped tests due to workflow mocking issues
- Tests not properly categorized

### After Fixes
- ✅ Parallel testing enabled
- ✅ Stablecoin tests properly refactored
- ✅ Better test isolation
- ⚠️ 76 unit tests still failing (need individual fixes)
- ✅ 366 tests passing
- ✅ Documentation created

## Next Steps

The remaining test failures are mostly related to:
1. Service container configuration in tests
2. Mock expectations that need adjustment for parallel execution
3. Tests that should be integration tests but are unit tests

Each failing test needs individual attention to fix properly.
