# Documentation Accuracy Report - July 2025

## Executive Summary

This report identifies critical discrepancies between the FinAegis platform documentation and actual implementation as of July 2025. Several major features are documented as complete but not implemented, requiring either implementation or documentation updates.

## Critical Discrepancies

### 1. Authentication & Security
**Documentation Claims**: Complete authentication system with 2FA, OAuth2, password reset
**Reality**: Only basic login/registration exists
- ❌ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - NOT implemented
- ❌ OAuth2/Social login - NOT implemented  
- ❌ Password reset endpoints - NOT implemented
- ❌ Email verification - NOT implemented

**Action Required**: Either implement these security features (HIGH PRIORITY) or update documentation

### 2. Global Currency Unit (GCU) Operations
**Documentation Claims**: Full GCU trading capabilities
**Reality**: Only informational endpoints exist
- ❌ GCU buy/sell operations - NOT implemented
- ❌ Democratic voting for composition changes - NOT implemented
- ✅ GCU information endpoints - Implemented

**Action Required**: Implement GCU trading operations as this is a core feature

### 3. Phase 7 - Unified Platform Features
**Documentation Claims**: Complete crypto exchange, P2P lending, advanced features
**Reality**: Basic multi-asset support only
- ❌ Crypto exchange capabilities - NOT implemented
- ❌ P2P Lending Platform - NOT implemented
- ❌ HD wallet infrastructure - NOT implemented
- ❌ Blockchain integration - NOT implemented

**Action Required**: Update documentation to reflect actual status or create implementation roadmap

### 4. Compliance Features
**Documentation Claims**: Advanced KYC/AML with multi-tier verification
**Reality**: Basic KYC implementation only
- ✅ Basic KYC verification - Implemented
- ❌ Multi-tier KYC levels - NOT implemented
- ❌ Sanctions screening - NOT implemented
- ❌ Advanced pattern detection - NOT implemented

**Action Required**: Enhance compliance features for production readiness

## Correctly Documented Features

The following features are accurately documented and implemented:
- ✅ Core banking operations (accounts, transactions, transfers)
- ✅ Multi-asset support with exchange rates
- ✅ Event sourcing architecture with saga patterns
- ✅ Democratic governance and voting system
- ✅ Webhook management system
- ✅ Filament admin dashboard
- ✅ Performance testing framework
- ✅ Custodian integration (Paysera, banks)
- ✅ Business team management
- ✅ API documentation (OpenAPI)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Security**: Implement missing authentication features (2FA, password reset)
2. **GCU Operations**: Implement buy/sell functionality for GCU
3. **Documentation**: Update Phase 7 documentation to reflect actual status

### Medium Priority
1. **Compliance**: Enhance KYC/AML features for production
2. **API Documentation**: Sync endpoint documentation with actual routes
3. **Feature Flags**: Clearly mark unimplemented features in docs

### Documentation Standards
1. Add "Implementation Status" badges to all feature documentation
2. Create a feature roadmap showing planned vs implemented
3. Regular documentation audits (monthly)

## Conclusion

While the core banking platform is well-implemented with event sourcing and multi-asset support, several documented features don't exist. The most critical gaps are in security (no 2FA or password reset) and GCU operations (no trading functionality). These should be addressed before production launch.
