# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded or is no longer actively maintained. Files are preserved for historical reference only.

## Why Archive?

We archive documentation when:
- Content has been consolidated into newer, comprehensive docs
- Information is outdated but may have historical value
- Documents are superseded by better alternatives
