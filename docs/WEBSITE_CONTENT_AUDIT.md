# FinAegis Website Content & UX Audit

## Executive Summary

The current FinAegis platform lacks the public-facing presence expected of a professional banking platform. This document outlines the comprehensive content and UX improvements needed to transform the platform from a basic Laravel application to a professional financial services website.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Content
- ✅ Functional authenticated user dashboard
- ✅ GCU wallet features (transactions, voting, bank allocation)
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ Admin panel (Filament)
- ❌ Professional landing page
- ❌ Public information pages
- ❌ User onboarding
- ❌ Help and support content

### Key Issues
1. **No Brand Identity**: Using default Laravel branding
2. **Missing Trust Signals**: No security, compliance, or company information
3. **Poor First Impressions**: Generic welcome page
4. **No User Guidance**: Lacks onboarding, help texts, and tutorials
5. **Limited Navigation**: No public navigation structure
