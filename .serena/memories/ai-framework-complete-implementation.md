# AI Agent Framework - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The FinAegis AI Agent Framework provides a complete Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for banking operations, enabling AI agents to interact with core banking services through a standardized interface.

## Architecture Components

### Core Infrastructure
1. **MCPServer** (`app/Domain/AI/MCP/MCPServer.php`)
   - Central server handling MCP protocol requests
   - Tool registration and execution
   - Conversation management with event sourcing
   - Caching layer for performance

2. **ToolRegistry** (`app/Domain/AI/MCP/ToolRegistry.php`)
   - Dynamic tool registration system
   - Tool discovery and listing
   - Input/output schema validation

3. **ResourceManager** (`app/Domain/AI/MCP/ResourceManager.php`)
   - Document and data exposure as MCP resources
   - Resource URI management

4. **AIInteractionAggregate** (`app/Domain/AI/Aggregates/AIInteractionAggregate.php`)
   - Event sourcing aggregate for AI interactions
   - Records all conversations, decisions, and tool executions
   - Critical for audit and compliance

### MCP Tools Implementation

#### Account Domain Tools (4 tools)
- **AccountBalanceTool**: Query account balances
- **CreateAccountTool**: Create new accounts with workflow integration
- **DepositTool**: Handle deposits with balance updates
- **WithdrawTool**: Process withdrawals with validation

#### Payment Domain Tools (2 tools)
- **TransferTool**: Account-to-account transfers via TransferService
- **PaymentStatusTool**: Track payment and transfer status

#### Exchange Domain Tools (3 tools)
- **QuoteTool**: Get exchange rate quotes
- **TradeTool**: Execute trades with order matching
- **LiquidityPoolTool**: Manage AMM liquidity pools

#### Compliance Domain Tools (2 tools)
- **KycTool**: KYC verification integration
- **AmlScreeningTool**: AML screening and risk assessment

### Event Sourcing Integration
All AI interactions are recorded as domain events:
- `ConversationStartedEvent`
- `AgentCreatedEvent`
- `IntentClassifiedEvent`
- `AIDecisionMadeEvent`
- `ToolExecutedEvent`
- `ConversationEndedEvent`

### Workflow Integration
- **CustomerServiceWorkflow**: Orchestrates AI agent operations
- Integrates with existing domain workflows (AccountWorkflow, TransferWorkflow)
- Supports saga pattern for compensation

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: AIInteractionAggregate, ToolRegistry, ResourceManager, Value Objects
- **Feature Tests**: All MCP tools with domain service integration
- **Integration Tests**: MCPServer with tool execution
- **Skip**: Workflows (complex async orchestration)

### Test Locations
- Unit: `tests/Unit/Domain/AI/`
- Feature: `tests/Feature/Domain/AI/`
- Tools: `tests/Feature/Domain/AI/MCP/Tools/[Domain]/`

## Integration Patterns

### Service Integration
All tools properly integrate with domain services:
- Account tools → AccountService
- Payment tools → TransferService
- Exchange tools → ExchangeService, LiquidityPoolService
- Compliance tools → ComplianceService

### Authorization
- User context validation
- Permission checks for sensitive operations
- Role-based access control integration

### Caching Strategy
- Read operations cached with TTL
- Cache invalidation on write operations
- Performance target: <100ms response time

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tools
1. Implement MCPToolInterface
2. Define input/output schemas
3. Integrate with domain service
4. Register in service provider
5. Add feature tests
6. Update documentation

### Code Quality Standards
- PHPStan Level 5 compliance
- PHPCS PSR-12 standard
- PHP CS Fixer formatting
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new code

## Next Development Phases
1. **Lending Tools**: Loan applications, credit scoring
2. **Stablecoin Tools**: Mint, burn, collateral management
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Risk assessment, fraud detection
4. **Workflow Automation**: Complex multi-step operations
