# AI Agent Framework Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive AI Agent Framework for FinAegis using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns, event sourcing, and workflow orchestration.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Domain Structure (app/Domain/AI/)
- **Aggregates**: AIInteractionAggregate for event sourcing
- **Events**: AIDecisionMadeEvent, ToolExecutedEvent, ConversationStartedEvent, etc.
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol server implementation
- **Workflows**: CustomerServiceWorkflow using Laravel Workflow
- **ValueObjects**: MCPRequest, MCPResponse, ToolExecutionResult
- **Contracts**: MCPServerInterface, MCPToolInterface
- **Exceptions**: MCPException, ToolNotFoundException

### 2. MCP Server Implementation
- Full MCP protocol support with tools, resources, prompts
- Event sourcing for all AI decisions and tool executions
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 3. Tool Registry System
- Dynamic tool registration and discovery
- Category-based organization
- Schema validation for inputs/outputs
- Caching support with configurable TTL
- Permission-based access control

### 4. Existing Service Integration
Example tools created:
- AccountBalanceTool: Wraps AccountService for balance inquiries
- Payment tools: Transfer operations
- Exchange tools: Currency quotes and trades
- Compliance tools: KYC/AML checks
- Lending tools: Loan applications and credit scoring

### 5. Customer Service Workflow
- Laravel Workflow-based implementation
- Multi-step process: validate → process → classify → execute → respond
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Compensation support for failure handling
- Human-in-the-loop for low confidence decisions

### 6. Testing Framework
- Comprehensive test coverage for MCP server
- Tool execution tests with mocking
- Event sourcing verification
- Performance benchmarking
- Cache testing

## Key Design Patterns Used

1. **Event Sourcing**: All AI decisions stored as events
2. **CQRS**: Command/Query separation for operations
3. **Saga Pattern**: Multi-step workflows with compensation
4. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access
5. **Factory Pattern**: Tool and agent creation
6. **Strategy Pattern**: Intent classification and routing

## Integration Points

- **Existing Services**: All domain services exposed as MCP tools
- **Event Store**: Spatie Event Sourcing for audit trail
- **Laravel Workflow**: Saga orchestration for complex operations
- **Redis**: Conversation context and caching
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum integration

## Performance Considerations

- Tool execution caching (30-second TTL for reads)
- Parallel tool execution support
- Performance categorization (<100ms excellent, <500ms good)
- Resource monitoring and circuit breakers

## Security Features

- Authentication required for all MCP operations
- Authorization checks per tool execution
- Audit logging for compliance
- Input validation against JSON schemas
- Rate limiting support

## Future Enhancements

1. Vector database integration for semantic search
2. Multi-agent coordination
3. Advanced RAG implementation
4. Streaming support for real-time responses
5. Production AI service integration (OpenAI, Claude)
