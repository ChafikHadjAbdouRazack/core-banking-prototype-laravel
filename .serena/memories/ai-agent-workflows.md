# AI Agent Workflows - Phase 3 Complete

## Overview
The FinAegis platform now includes comprehensive AI Agent Workflows (Phase 3 complete as of January 2025).

## Implemented Workflows

### 1. CustomerServiceWorkflow
- **Location**: `app/Domain/AI/Workflows/CustomerServiceWorkflow.php`
- **Features**: Natural language processing, intent classification, confidence scoring
- **Integration**: Maps intents to MCP tools (balance, transfer, exchange, KYC)

### 2. ComplianceWorkflow  
- **Location**: `app/Domain/AI/Workflows/ComplianceWorkflow.php`
- **Features**: KYC/AML checks, transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting
- **Services**: KycService, AmlScreeningService, TransactionMonitoringService, RegulatoryReportingService
- **Pattern**: Saga with compensation support

### 3. RiskAssessmentSaga
- **Location**: `app/Domain/AI/Workflows/RiskAssessmentSaga.php`
- **Features**: Credit risk, fraud detection, portfolio analysis
- **Services**: DefaultRiskAssessmentService, TransactionMonitoringService
- **Assessments**: Credit scoring, fraud patterns, portfolio diversification, behavioral analysis

## Key Patterns

### Event Sourcing
All workflows use `AIInteractionAggregate` for event sourcing:
- startConversation()
- makeDecision() with confidence scoring
- endConversation()
- Full audit trail via domain events

### Saga Pattern
Compensation support for multi-step operations:
- Track compensationActions array
- Rollback in reverse order on failure
- Automatic compensation via compensate() method

### Confidence Scoring
All AI decisions include confidence levels:
- High confidence (>0.9): Low/high risk scenarios
- Medium confidence (0.6-0.9): Uncertain cases
- Low confidence (<0.7): Triggers human review

## Service Integration Notes

### Simplified Services
Some service methods are simplified for demo:
- KycService uses performVerification() (simplified)
- AmlScreeningService uses performScreening() (simplified)
- TransactionMonitoringService uses detectSuspiciousPatterns() (simplified)

### PHPStan Considerations
Some properties are write-only for workflow tracking:
- $context: Stores workflow context (may be used in future)
- $executionHistory: Tracks workflow steps (for debugging/audit)
- These are intentional for future expansion

## Testing
All workflows designed for testability:
- Generator-based execution
- Event sourcing verification
- Mock service support
- Compensation testing

## Documentation
- Main docs: `docs/13-AI-FRAMEWORK/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md`
- README updated with Phase 3 completion
- TODO.md marked Phase 3 as complete
