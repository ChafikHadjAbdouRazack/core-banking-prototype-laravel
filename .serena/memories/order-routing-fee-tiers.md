# Order Routing & Fee Tier System

## Overview
Advanced liquidity pool features implementing intelligent order routing and tiered fee structures for optimal trade execution.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Order Routing Saga (`OrderRoutingSaga`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligently routes orders across multiple liquidity pools for best execution
- **Key Features**:
  - Finds optimal execution paths considering price impact, fees, and liquidity
  - Supports order splitting across multiple pools for large orders
  - Calculates effective prices including fees and slippage
  - Filters pools by status and minimum liquidity
  - Handles no liquidity scenarios gracefully

### 2. Fee Tier Service (`FeeTierService`)
- **Purpose**: Manages volume-based fee tiers and pool-specific fee structures
- **Fee Tiers**:
  - Retail: 0.30%/0.40% (maker/taker)
  - Bronze: 0.25%/0.35% ($10k+ volume)
  - Silver: 0.20%/0.30% ($50k+ volume)
  - Gold: 0.15%/0.25% ($250k+ volume)
  - Platinum: 0.10%/0.20% ($1M+ volume)
  - VIP: 0.05%/0.15% ($5M+ volume)
- **Pool Fee Categories**:
  - Stable pairs: 0.05% (USDT/USDC)
  - Standard pairs: 0.30%
  - Exotic pairs: 1.00%

## Events Created
- `OrderRouted`: Order successfully routed to a pool
- `OrderSplit`: Large order split across multiple pools
- `RoutingFailed`: Order routing failed (no liquidity)
- `FeeTierUpdated`: Pool fee tier changed
- `UserFeeTierAssigned`: User assigned to specific tier

## Testing
Comprehensive unit tests cover:
- Single pool routing with best price selection
- Order splitting for large orders
- No liquidity handling
- Price impact consideration
- Fee tier calculations
- Volume-based tier assignments

## Integration Points
- Works with existing `LiquidityPoolService` for pool management
- Integrates with `OrderService` for order updates
- Uses event sourcing for all state changes
- Caches fee tier data for performance

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time price feeds from external oracles
- Cross-chain routing capabilities
- MEV protection mechanisms
- Dynamic fee adjustments based on market conditions
