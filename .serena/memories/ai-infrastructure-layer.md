# AI Infrastructure Layer Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of the AI Infrastructure Layer for the FinAegis platform, providing external AI integrations with event sourcing, conversation management, and vector search capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. LLM Providers
Located in `app/Infrastructure/AI/LLM/`:
- **OpenAIProvider.php** - OpenAI GPT integration with chat, streaming, and embeddings
- **ClaudeProvider.php** - Anthropic Claude integration with chat and streaming
- **LLMProviderInterface.php** - Common interface for all LLM providers

Features:
- Event sourcing integration via AIInteractionAggregate
- Response caching for performance optimization
- Token usage tracking and statistics
- Error handling with automatic retry logic
- Support for streaming responses

### 2. Conversation Storage
Located in `app/Infrastructure/AI/Storage/`:
- **ConversationStore.php** - Redis-based conversation persistence
- **ConversationStoreInterface.php** - Storage abstraction interface

Features:
- Store and retrieve conversation contexts
- User conversation history management
- Search conversations by content
- Automatic trimming (keep last 100 conversations per user)
- TTL-based expiration (24 hours default)

### 3. Vector Database
Located in `app/Infrastructure/AI/VectorDB/`:
- **PineconeProvider.php** - Pinecone vector database integration
- **VectorDatabaseInterface.php** - Vector database abstraction

Features:
- Store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors
- Semantic similarity search with filtering
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Index management (create, stats, availability)
- Caching for frequently accessed data

### 4. Value Objects
Located in `app/Domain/AI/ValueObjects/`:
- **LLMResponse.php** - Structured LLM response with token tracking
- **ConversationContext.php** - Immutable conversation state

### 5. Domain Events
Located in `app/Domain/AI/Events/`:
- **LLMRequestMadeEvent.php** - Tracks LLM requests
- **LLMResponseReceivedEvent.php** - Tracks successful responses
- **LLMErrorEvent.php** - Tracks failures for monitoring

### 6. Service Provider
- **AIInfrastructureServiceProvider.php** - Dependency injection configuration
- Dynamic provider selection based on configuration
- Automatic index creation for vector database

### 7. Configuration
- **config/ai.php** - Centralized AI service configuration
- **config/services.php** - Service credentials and settings
- Environment-based provider selection
- Configurable token limits and temperatures

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/Unit/Infrastructure/AI/`:
- **OpenAIProviderTest.php** - OpenAI integration tests
- **ConversationStoreTest.php** - Redis storage tests
- **PineconeProviderTest.php** - Vector database tests

Test features:
- Mock HTTP clients for external services
- Cache verification tests
- Error handling scenarios
- Batch operation testing
- Search and filtering validation

## Architecture Patterns

### Event Sourcing
All LLM interactions are recorded as domain events:
```php
$aggregate = AIInteractionAggregate::retrieve($conversationId);
$aggregate->recordLLMRequest($userId, 'openai', $message, $options);
$aggregate->persist();
```

### Caching Strategy
Multi-level caching for performance:
- LLM responses cached for 1 hour
- Vector search results cached for 5 minutes
- Usage statistics cached for 5 minutes

### Error Handling
Graceful degradation with fallback strategies:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Event recording for all failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Usage Examples

### Using LLM Provider
```php
$provider = app(LLMProviderInterface::class);
$context = new ConversationContext($conversationId, $userId);
$response = $provider->chat("What is Laravel?", $context);
```

### Storing Conversations
```php
$store = app(ConversationStoreInterface::class);
$store->store($context);
$retrieved = $store->retrieve($conversationId);
```

### Vector Search
```php
$vectorDb = app(VectorDatabaseInterface::class);
$embeddings = $provider->generateEmbeddings("search query");
$results = $vectorDb->search($embeddings, topK: 10);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# LLM Configuration
AI_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000

# Vector Database
AI_VECTOR_DB_PROVIDER=pinecone
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=finaegis-ai

# Conversation Storage
AI_CONVERSATION_TTL=86400
AI_MAX_CONVERSATIONS_PER_USER=100
```

## Code Quality
- **PHPStan Level 5**: Zero errors
- **PHPCS PSR-12**: Fully compliant
- **PHP CS Fixer**: All style issues resolved
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all components

## Integration Points
- Integrates with existing AIInteractionAggregate for event sourcing
- Works with MCP Server and Tool Registry
- Compatible with all AI Workflows and Sagas
- Supports demo mode with configurable providers

## Next Steps
1. Implement additional LLM providers (Gemini, Llama)
2. Add more vector database providers (Weaviate, Qdrant)
3. Implement conversation analytics and insights
4. Add support for multimodal inputs (images, documents)
5. Create admin panel for AI monitoring and management
