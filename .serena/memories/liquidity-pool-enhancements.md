# Liquidity Pool Enhancements - January 2025

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive liquidity pool enhancements including spread management saga and market maker workflow, following DDD, event sourcing, and saga patterns.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Spread Management Saga (`app/Domain/Exchange/Sagas/SpreadManagementSaga.php`)
- Monitors liquidity pool events and adjusts spreads dynamically
- Reacts to liquidity changes, inventory imbalances, and market volatility
- Implements thresholds for automatic spread adjustments:
  - MIN_SPREAD_BPS = 10 (0.1%)
  - MAX_SPREAD_BPS = 500 (5%)
  - DEFAULT_SPREAD_BPS = 30 (0.3%)
  - INVENTORY_IMBALANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.2 (20%)
  - CRITICAL_IMBALANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4 (40%)

### 2. Market Maker Workflow (`app/Domain/Exchange/Workflows/MarketMakerWorkflow.php`)
- Provides continuous liquidity with automated bid/ask orders
- Implements risk management with configurable limits
- Activities include:
  - MonitorMarketConditionsActivity
  - CalculateOptimalQuotesActivity
  - PlaceOrderActivity
  - CancelOrderActivity
  - AdjustInventoryActivity

### 3. Event Sourcing Events
Created new events for spread management and market making:
- `SpreadAdjusted`: Records spread changes with reasons
- `InventoryImbalanceDetected`: Tracks inventory deviations
- `MarketVolatilityChanged`: Monitors volatility changes
- `MarketMakerStarted/Stopped`: Lifecycle events
- `QuotesUpdated`: Quote updates from market maker
- `OrderExecuted`: Order execution tracking

### 4. Activities
- **MonitorMarketConditionsActivity**: Tracks market metrics including volatility, volume, inventory
- **CalculateOptimalQuotesActivity**: Determines optimal bid/ask prices based on market conditions
- **PlaceOrderActivity**: Places orders in the order book
- **CancelOrderActivity**: Cancels existing orders
- **AdjustInventoryActivity**: Rebalances inventory to maintain target ratios

## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Saga Pattern**: SpreadManagementSaga for long-running business transactions
2. **Workflow Pattern**: MarketMakerWorkflow for orchestrating activities
3. **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as events
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of domain logic and infrastructure

### Key Features
- Dynamic spread adjustment based on:
  - Liquidity depth (TVL-based adjustments)
  - Market volatility (widens spread during high volatility)
  - Inventory imbalance (adjusts to encourage rebalancing)
- Automatic inventory rebalancing when imbalance exceeds thresholds
- Risk management with configurable limits for inventory, volatility, and P&L
- Caching strategies for performance optimization

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `OrderService` for order management
- Integrates with `LiquidityPoolService` for pool operations
- Leverages Laravel's Cache facade for performance metrics
- Event-driven architecture with Laravel events

## Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for SpreadManagementSaga
- Tests for market maker workflow behavior
- Mocked dependencies using Mockery
- Tests cover:
  - Spread recalculation on liquidity changes
  - Inventory imbalance detection
  - Volatility-based adjustments
  - Risk limit enforcement

## Configuration
Event sourcing configuration updated in `config/event-sourcing.php`:
```php
'spread_adjusted' => SpreadAdjusted::class,
'inventory_imbalance_detected' => InventoryImbalanceDetected::class,
'market_volatility_changed' => MarketVolatilityChanged::class,
'market_maker_started' => MarketMakerStarted::class,
'market_maker_stopped' => MarketMakerStopped::class,
'quotes_updated' => QuotesUpdated::class,
'order_executed' => OrderExecuted::class,
```

## Next Steps
- Implement backtesting framework for market maker strategies
- Add more sophisticated pricing models (e.g., Avellaneda-Stoikov)
- Integrate with external price feeds for better market data
- Implement multi-asset market making strategies
- Add performance analytics and reporting dashboard
