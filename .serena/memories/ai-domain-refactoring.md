# AI Domain Refactoring - Clean Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Major refactoring of the AI domain to follow clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns using Activities, Child Workflows, and Sagas.

## Refactoring Results

### Before vs After Metrics
- **TradingAgentWorkflow**: 720 lines → 194 lines (73% reduction)
- **Code Organization**: Monolithic workflows → Modular components
- **Testability**: Complex mocking → Simple unit tests per activity
- **Reusability**: Low → High (activities reusable across workflows)

## New Architecture Structure

### 1. Activities (Atomic Business Logic)
Located in `app/Domain/AI/Activities/`:
- **Trading/**
  - `CalculateRSIActivity.php` - RSI technical indicator calculation
  - `CalculateMACDActivity.php` - MACD indicator calculation
  - `IdentifyPatternsActivity.php` - Chart pattern identification
  - `GenerateMomentumStrategyActivity.php` - Momentum trading strategies
- **Risk/**
  - `CalculateVaRActivity.php` - Value at Risk calculation
  - `CalculateCreditScoreActivity.php` - Credit score computation
- **Portfolio/**
  - (Future: OptimizeAllocationActivity, RebalancePortfolioActivity)

### 2. Child Workflows (Focused Operations)
Located in `app/Domain/AI/ChildWorkflows/`:
- **Trading/**
  - `MarketAnalysisWorkflow.php` - Orchestrates technical analysis
  - `StrategyGenerationWorkflow.php` - Creates trading strategies
- **Risk/**
  - (Future: CreditRiskWorkflow, FraudDetectionWorkflow)
- **Approval/**
  - (Future: ConfidenceEvaluationWorkflow, EscalationWorkflow)

### 3. Sagas (Compensatable Operations)
Located in `app/Domain/AI/Sagas/`:
- `TradingExecutionSaga.php` - Executes trades with rollback support
  - Locks funds → Creates order → Executes → Updates portfolio
  - Full compensation stack for failure recovery
- (Existing: RiskAssessmentSaga - to be refactored)

### 4. Events (Domain Events)
Located in `app/Domain/AI/Events/`:
- **Trading/**
  - `MarketAnalyzedEvent.php` - Emitted after market analysis
  - `StrategyGeneratedEvent.php` - Emitted after strategy creation
  - `TradeExecutedEvent.php` - Emitted after successful trade

### Risk Domain
#### Activities
- `CalculateCreditScoreActivity.php` - Credit score calculation
- `CalculateDebtRatiosActivity.php` - DTI ratio calculation
- `CalculateVaRActivity.php` - Value at Risk calculation (existing)
- `EvaluateLoanAffordabilityActivity.php` - Loan affordability assessment
- `AnalyzeTransactionVelocityActivity.php` - Velocity check for fraud
- `DetectAnomaliesActivity.php` - Anomaly detection for fraud
- `VerifyDeviceAndLocationActivity.php` - Device/location verification

#### Child Workflows
- `CreditRiskWorkflow.php` - Credit risk assessment orchestration
- `FraudDetectionWorkflow.php` - Fraud detection orchestration

#### Sagas (Refactored)
- `RiskAssessmentSaga.php` - Comprehensive risk evaluation with compensation
  - Reduced from 782 to ~350 lines (55% reduction)
  - Now uses child workflows for orchestration
  - Cleaner separation of concerns

#### Events
- `CreditAssessedEvent.php` - Emitted after credit assessment
- `FraudAssessedEvent.php` - Emitted after fraud detection

## Key Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each component has one clear responsibility:
- Activities: Pure business logic calculations
- Child Workflows: Orchestration of related activities
- Sagas: Transactional operations with compensation
- Main Workflows: High-level orchestration only

### 2. Dependency Injection
All activities and workflows are resolved through Laravel's container, enabling easy testing and mocking.

### 3. Event Sourcing
All state changes emit domain events stored via `AIInteractionAggregate`.

### 4. Saga Pattern
Complex operations use compensation stacks for automatic rollback on failure.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Activities tested in isolation (see `CalculateRSIActivityTest.php`)
- Pure functions with predictable inputs/outputs
- No external dependencies

### Feature Tests
- Child Workflows tested with mocked activities (see `MarketAnalysisWorkflowTest.php`, `CreditRiskWorkflowTest.php`)
- Event emission verification
- Sentiment calculation validation

### Integration Tests
- Sagas tested with real services
- Compensation verification
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Migration Path

### Completed
1. ✅ Created Activities for Trading calculations (6 activities)
2. ✅ Created Child Workflows for Trading (2 workflows)
3. ✅ Created TradingExecutionSaga with compensation
4. ✅ Refactored TradingAgentWorkflow to orchestration-only (73% reduction)
5. ✅ Created Activities for Risk assessment (7 activities)
6. ✅ Created Child Workflows for Risk (2 workflows)
7. ✅ Refactored RiskAssessmentSaga with child workflows (55% reduction)
8. ✅ Added comprehensive Events for both domains
9. ✅ Created unit and feature tests
10. ✅ Fixed all PHPStan issues for production readiness

### Pending
1. Refactor HumanInTheLoopWorkflow
2. Create Portfolio optimization activities
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to locate and modify code
2. **Testability**: Each component tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Activities can be reused across different workflows
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new activities and workflows
5. **Reliability**: Saga pattern ensures data consistency
6. **Performance**: Smaller components load faster, better memory usage

## Code Quality Metrics
- PHPStan Level 5: ✅ All files pass
- PHPCS PSR-12: ✅ Fully compliant
- Test Coverage: Ready for comprehensive testing

## Usage Examples

### Using an Activity
```php
$rsiActivity = app(CalculateRSIActivity::class);
$result = $rsiActivity->execute([
    'prices' => [50000, 51000, 52000, ...],
    'period' => 14
]);
```

### Using a Child Workflow
```php
$marketAnalysis = yield from app(MarketAnalysisWorkflow::class)->execute(
    $conversationId,
    'BTC/USD',
    $marketData
);
```

### Using a Saga
```php
$execution = yield from app(TradingExecutionSaga::class)->execute(
    $conversationId,
    $userId,
    $strategy
);
```

## Next Steps
Continue refactoring remaining workflows following the same patterns to achieve consistent architecture across the entire AI domain.
