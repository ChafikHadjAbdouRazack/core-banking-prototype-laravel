# Enhanced Collateral Management Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive collateral management system for stablecoins using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event Sourcing, and the Saga pattern.

## Key Components

### 1. Aggregates
- **CollateralPositionAggregate**: Main aggregate for managing collateral positions with event sourcing
  - Location: `app/Domain/Stablecoin/Aggregates/CollateralPositionAggregate.php`
  - Manages position lifecycle: creation, collateral operations, health monitoring, liquidation
  - Full event sourcing implementation with Spatie EventSourcing

### 2. Events (11 events)
- CollateralPositionCreated, CollateralAdded, CollateralWithdrawn
- CollateralPriceUpdated, CollateralHealthChecked, MarginCallIssued
- CollateralLiquidationStarted, CollateralLiquidationCompleted
- CollateralRebalanced, CollateralPositionClosed
- All in `app/Domain/Stablecoin/Events/`

### 3. Value Objects
- **CollateralRatio**: Manages collateral-to-debt ratios with validation
- **CollateralType**: Enum for collateral types (CRYPTO, FIAT, COMMODITY, MIXED, ALGORITHMIC)
- **LiquidationThreshold**: Calculates liquidation, margin call, and safe levels
- **PositionHealth**: Determines position status (HEALTHY, AT_RISK, MARGIN_CALL, LIQUIDATION)
- **AuctionResult**: Encapsulates liquidation auction outcomes
- **Hash**: SHA3-512 hashing for event integrity
- All in `app/Domain/Stablecoin/ValueObjects/`

### 4. Sagas
- **CollateralLiquidationSaga**: Multi-step liquidation process with compensation
  - Location: `app/Domain/Stablecoin/Sagas/CollateralLiquidationSaga.php`
  - Handles margin calls, auction management, collateral transfers
  - Full compensation logic for failure scenarios

### 5. Workflows
- **CollateralRebalancingWorkflow**: Portfolio rebalancing using Laravel Workflow
  - Location: `app/Domain/Stablecoin/Workflows/CollateralRebalancingWorkflow.php`
  - Activities: AnalyzeCollateralPortfolioActivity, CalculateRebalancingStrategyActivity, ValidateRebalancingActivity, ExecuteCollateralSwapActivity
  - Supports parallel rebalancing of multiple positions

### 6. Services
- **LiquidationAuctionService**: Manages collateral liquidation auctions
- **PriceOracleService**: Price feeds with multiple data sources and weighted averaging

### 7. Models
- **LiquidationAuction**: Auction entity for collateral liquidation
- **LiquidationBid**: Bid tracking for auctions

### 8. Projectors
- **CollateralPositionProjector**: Handles new enhanced collateral events
- Updated **StablecoinProjector** to skip new events

## Event Registration
All events registered in `config/event-sourcing.php`:
- collateral_added, collateral_withdrawn, collateral_price_updated
- collateral_health_checked, margin_call_issued
- collateral_liquidation_started, collateral_liquidation_completed
- collateral_rebalanced

## Technical Decisions
1. Used DateTimeImmutable for all event timestamps
2. Created Hash value object in Shared domain for event integrity
3. Implemented nullable properties for optional aggregate state
4. Added comprehensive health calculations with zero-debt handling
5. Created separate projector for new events to avoid conflicts

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/Stablecoin/CollateralPositionAggregateTest.php`:
- 13 test cases covering position lifecycle
- Tests for creation, collateral operations, health checks, liquidation

## Code Quality
- PHPStan Level 5 compliance
- PHP-CS-Fixer PSR-12 standards
- All DateTime types properly handled
- Proper error handling for division by zero

## Next Steps
- API endpoints need to be created for collateral operations
- Production read models for projectors
- Integration with existing stablecoin minting/burning
- Performance optimization for large-scale operations
