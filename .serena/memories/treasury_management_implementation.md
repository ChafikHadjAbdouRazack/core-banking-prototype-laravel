# Treasury Management System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete Treasury Management System following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with event sourcing, sagas, and workflows.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Event Sourcing Structure
- **TreasuryAggregate**: Core aggregate root implementing event sourcing
- **Separate Event Storage**: Uses dedicated `treasury_events` and `treasury_snapshots` tables
- **Custom Repositories**: TreasuryEventRepository and TreasurySnapshotRepository for isolated storage

### 2. Domain Events
- TreasuryAccountCreated: Initial account setup
- CashAllocated: Cash allocation based on strategy
- YieldOptimizationStarted: Yield optimization initiation
- RiskAssessmentCompleted: Risk assessment results
- RegulatoryReportGenerated: Regulatory report generation

### 3. Value Objects
- **AllocationStrategy**: Defines investment allocation strategies (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive, Custom)
- **RiskProfile**: Risk assessment with levels (Low, Medium, High, Very High)

### 4. Services
- **YieldOptimizationService**: Optimizes portfolio yields based on risk constraints
- **RegulatoryReportingService**: Generates regulatory reports (BASEL III, FORM 10Q, etc.)

### 5. Workflows & Activities
- **CashManagementWorkflow**: Orchestrates cash allocation with compensation support
- Activities: AllocateCashActivity, AnalyzeLiquidityActivity, OptimizeYieldActivity, ValidateAllocationActivity

### 6. Saga Pattern
- **RiskManagementSaga**: Handles risk assessment and mitigation as a Reactor
- Monitors treasury operations and triggers risk assessments
- Implements compensation for failed operations

### 7. Test Coverage
- Comprehensive test suite in tests/Feature/Treasury/TreasuryAggregateTest.php
- Tests event sourcing, allocations, risk assessment, and regulatory reporting
- Validates separate event storage implementation

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Strategy Allocation**: Supports different investment strategies with customizable allocations
2. **Risk Management**: Integrated risk profiling and assessment throughout operations
3. **Yield Optimization**: Intelligent yield optimization based on risk constraints
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in regulatory reporting for various standards
5. **Saga Compensation**: Automatic rollback of failed operations
6. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all treasury operations

## Configuration

### Event Class Map
Treasury events are registered in config/event-sourcing.php:
- treasury_account_created
- cash_allocated
- yield_optimization_started
- risk_assessment_completed
- regulatory_report_generated

### Service Provider
TreasuryServiceProvider registers all repositories and services for dependency injection.

## Database Schema

### treasury_events table
- Stores all treasury domain events
- Inherits structure from Spatie EventSourcing

### treasury_snapshots table
- Stores aggregate snapshots for performance
- Reduces event replay overhead

## Integration Points

1. **CQRS Pattern**: Ready for command/query bus integration
2. **Domain Event Bus**: Publishes events for other domains
3. **Workflow Engine**: Uses Laravel Workflow for orchestration
4. **Event Sourcing**: Spatie Laravel Event Sourcing package

## Testing
- All tests passing with proper event sourcing validation
- Separate event storage verified
- Code quality checks passed (PHPStan Level 5, PHP-CS-Fixer, PHPCS)

## Next Steps for Extension
1. Add command handlers for CQRS implementation
2. Implement query handlers for read models
3. Add more regulatory report templates
4. Enhance yield optimization algorithms
5. Implement real-time risk monitoring

## Important Implementation Notes
- Always use separate event storage per aggregate
- Implement saga compensation for workflow failures
- Use value objects for domain concepts
- Follow DDD patterns consistently
