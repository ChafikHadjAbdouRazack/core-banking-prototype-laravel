**Open Source Core Banking Prototype Demonstrating Modern Banking Architecture**

üåê **[Live Demo Available at https://finaegis.org](https://finaegis.org)** - Experience the prototype in action!

FinAegis is a comprehensive prototype of a core banking platform built with event sourcing, domain-driven design, and modern banking patterns. It demonstrates the technical architecture for innovative financial products including the **Global Currency Unit (GCU)** concept - a democratic digital currency vision backed by real banks.

üìñ **See [GCU Vision Documentation](docs/01-VISION/GCU_VISION.md) for the complete platform vision and GCU implementation details.**

**ü§ñ AI-Powered Banking Framework**: FinAegis now includes a complete AI Agent Framework for financial institutions. With full MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation, multi-LLM support (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude), and event-sourced architecture, it enables banks to deploy intelligent AI agents for customer service, compliance, risk assessment, and automated trading. Every AI interaction is recorded for complete audit trails and regulatory compliance.
