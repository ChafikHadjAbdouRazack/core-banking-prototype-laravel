# API Layer Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the complete API layer implementation for the FinAegis Core Banking Platform, including all endpoints, controllers, and integration with the event sourcing architecture.

> **Note**: A BIAN-compliant version of the API is now available. See [BIAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md](BIAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for the standards-based implementation following Banking Industry Architecture Network guidelines.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Created

#### 1. API Controllers

**AccountController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/AccountController.php`)
- Manages account lifecycle operations
- Integrates with event sourcing workflows
- Handles account creation with optional initial balance
- Validates business rules (e.g., no deletion of accounts with balance)

**TransactionController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/TransactionController.php`)
- Handles deposits and withdrawals
- Validates sufficient funds for withdrawals
- Queries event-sourced transaction history from stored_events table

**TransferController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/TransferController.php`)
- Manages money transfers between accounts
- Validates account existence and sufficient funds
- Records transfers through event sourcing

**BalanceController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/BalanceController.php`)
- Provides balance inquiries
- Returns balance summaries with turnover statistics
- Integrates with BalanceInquiryWorkflow

#### 2. Domain Components

**TransferActivity** (`app/Domain/Payment/Workflows/TransferActivity.php`)
- Orchestrates the transfer workflow
- Validates transfer before execution
- Executes withdrawal and deposit activities in sequence
- Records transfer for audit trail

**CreateSnapshot Command** (`app/Console/Commands/CreateSnapshot.php`)
- Creates performance snapshots for aggregates
- Supports transaction, transfer, and ledger snapshots
- Includes threshold limits and force options
- Provides progress feedback for bulk operations

#### 3. API Routes (`routes/api.php`)

All routes are protected with Sanctum authentication middleware:

```php
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
    // Account management
    Route::post('/accounts', [AccountController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('/accounts/{uuid}', [AccountController::class, 'show']);
    Route::delete('/accounts/{uuid}', [AccountController::class, 'destroy']);
    Route::post('/accounts/{uuid}/freeze', [AccountController::class, 'freeze']);
    Route::post('/accounts/{uuid}/unfreeze', [AccountController::class, 'unfreeze']);
    
    // Transactions
    Route::post('/accounts/{uuid}/deposit', [TransactionController::class, 'deposit']);
    Route::post('/accounts/{uuid}/withdraw', [TransactionController::class, 'withdraw']);
    Route::get('/accounts/{uuid}/transactions', [TransactionController::class, 'history']);
    
    // Transfers
    Route::post('/transfers', [TransferController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('/transfers/{uuid}', [TransferController::class, 'show']);
    Route::get('/accounts/{uuid}/transfers', [TransferController::class, 'history']);
    
    // Balance inquiries
    Route::get('/accounts/{uuid}/balance', [BalanceController::class, 'show']);
    Route::get('/accounts/{uuid}/balance/summary', [BalanceController::class, 'summary']);
});
```

### Technical Decisions

#### 1. Event Sourcing Integration
- Controllers query `stored_events` table directly for event-sourced data
- UUIDs generated in controllers before passing to workflows
- Event properties decoded from JSON for response formatting

#### 2. Authentication
- Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- All endpoints require authenticated user
- Tests use `Sanctum::actingAs()` for auth setup

#### 3. Error Handling
- Validation errors return 422 status
- Business rule violations return descriptive error messages
- Not found resources return 404 status

#### 4. Response Format
- Consistent JSON structure with `data` wrapper
- Includes relevant metadata for pagination
- Descriptive success/error messages

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suites for all components:

- `tests/Feature/Api/AccountControllerTest.php` - 11 tests
- `tests/Feature/Api/TransactionControllerTest.php` - 9 tests  
- `tests/Feature/Api/TransferControllerTest.php` - 11 tests
- `tests/Feature/Api/BalanceControllerTest.php` - 8 tests
- `tests/Domain/Payment/Workflows/TransferActivityTest.php` - 7 tests
- `tests/Console/Commands/CreateSnapshotTest.php` - 12 tests

### Issues Resolved

1. **Method Not Found Errors**
   - Fixed `AccountUuid::fromString()` → `new AccountUuid()`
   - Fixed `Money::fromInt()` → `new Money()`

2. **Database Column Issues**
   - Removed references to non-existent 'frozen' column
   - Fixed `aggregate_root_uuid` → `aggregate_uuid`

3. **Workflow Parameters**
   - Added required 'reason' parameter to freeze/unfreeze workflows
   - Added 'authorized_by' parameter where needed

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Fixed `auth()->logout()` incompatibility with Sanctum
   - Removed WorkflowStub::fake() calls that don't work properly

### API Usage Examples

#### Create Account
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "name": "Savings Account",
    "initial_balance": 1000
  }'
```

#### Make Deposit
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/accounts/{uuid}/deposit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 500,
    "description": "Salary deposit"
  }'
```

#### Transfer Money
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "to_account_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
    "amount": 250,
    "description": "Payment for services"
  }'
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Pagination** - Implement cursor-based pagination for history endpoints
2. **Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Webhook Support** - Send notifications for significant events
4. **Batch Operations** - Support bulk transfers and deposits
5. **Enhanced Security** - Add transaction signing and 2FA for sensitive operations

## Maintenance Notes

- Run `./vendor/bin/pest` to execute the test suite
- Event sourcing models don't have traditional Eloquent factories
- Workflow tests require special setup due to ActivityStub limitations
- Console commands with progress bars may interfere with output testing
